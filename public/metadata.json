    "description": "The image displays a Wikipedia article about Donald Trump, with a white background and black text. The text is formatted in a large font with blue highlights.\n\n**Paragraph 1:**\nBorn in New York City, Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in economics. He became president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it the Trump Organization, and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s, he began side ventures. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show The Apprentice. A political outsider, Trump won the 2016 presidential election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n**Paragraph 2:**\nTrump's campaign focused on anti-globalization and anti-immigration policies, as well as a promise to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington D.C. He was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. His presidency has been marked by controversy and polarization, with many critics accusing him of violating ethical norms and engaging in authoritarian behavior. Despite this, he has maintained a strong base of support among his loyal followers, who see him as a champion of American values and a defender of traditional culture.",
